An IoT-enabled, SaaS-based Smart Campus Platform designed to intelligently manage attendance, canteen payments, library automation, and learning engagement analytics using BLE-based proximity validation and real-time backend processing. 

*Developed as part of Project-Based Learning (PBL).*

## 🧠 Project Vision

Traditional campus systems treat attendance, library, and payments as isolated services. Furthermore, attendance only tracks physical presence, not actual student engagement.

**Identa transforms attendance into intelligent engagement monitoring.** We integrate IoT-based proximity validation with real-time analytics to classify student engagement, preventing proxy attendance and providing actionable insights to faculty and parents.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- **Prevent Proxy Attendance:** Utilize BLE-based proximity validation to ensure students are actually in the classroom.
- **Track True Engagement:** Combine attendance data with quiz performance for intelligent engagement classification.
- **Unified SaaS Platform:** Integrate canteen, library, and academic tracking into one seamless ecosystem.
- **Actionable Insights:** Enable real-time analytics dashboards for faculty and parents.
- **Future-Proof:** Build a 5G-ready, highly scalable architecture.

## 🏗️ System Architecture 

The platform follows a robust 5-layer architecture:

1. **User Layer:** Student Mobile App, Faculty Dashboard, Parent Dashboard.
2. **IoT Layer:** ESP32 BLE Classroom Beacons, Smart Gate Nodes (WiFi-enabled).
3. **Validation Layer:** Time-window verification, RSSI-based proximity validation, Enrollment authentication.
4. **Backend Layer:** REST APIs, functional modules (Attendance, Quiz, Library, Wallet), PostgreSQL Database.
5. **Analytics Layer:** Engagement classification engine, Risk detection, Faculty insights.
