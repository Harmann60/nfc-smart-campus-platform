# NFC-Based Smart Campus Platform (SaaS)

A SaaS-based Smart Campus system that uses NFC-enabled student ID cards to manage **canteen payments, attendance tracking, and library automation** through a unified platform.

This project is developed as part of our **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** coursework.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Educational institutions often rely on separate systems for attendance, library management, and canteen payments. These systems are either manual or poorly integrated, leading to inefficiencies, long queues, and lack of centralized control.

This project proposes a **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** solution that integrates all three services using **NFC-based student identification**, accessible from any device with a USB NFC reader.
