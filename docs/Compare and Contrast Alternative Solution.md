## 2. Comparison of Alternative Solutions

| Solution Method | Advantages | Limitations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manual Systems** | Simple to use, no infrastructure cost. | Time-consuming, error-prone, not scalable. |
| **Cash / UPI-Based Payments** | Familiar to users, easy to adopt. | Network dependency, slow verification, no system integration. |
| **Barcode / Magnetic Cards** | Low cost, simple hardware. | Easy duplication, wear and tear, limited security. |
| **Biometric Systems** | Strong user authentication. | Hygiene issues, high cost, privacy concerns. |
| **Standalone Software** | Digital record keeping. | Disconnected modules, limited scalability (Data Silos). |
| **ERP-Based Campus Systems** | Centralized data management. | Expensive, complex deployment and maintenance. |
| **NFC-Based SaaS Platform** | **Fast, secure, scalable, fully integrated.** | Initial setup effort required. |

## 3. Evaluation Criteria
Each solution was evaluated using the following engineering and operational factors:
1.  **Transaction speed** (Latency)
2.  **Accuracy of authentication** (False Acceptance/Rejection Rate)
3.  **Cost-effectiveness** (CAPEX vs OPEX)
4.  **Ease of deployment**
5.  **Scalability** across institutions
6.  **User convenience**
7.  **Security and hygiene**

## 4. Selected Solution: NFC-Based SaaS Platform


After comparing all alternatives, the **NFC-based Smart Campus SaaS platform** was selected as the most suitable solution because it:
* ✅ Uses a **single student identity** across all campus services.
* ✅ Enables **fast and contactless** operations (< 1 second tap).
* ✅ Reduces dependence on **cash and personal mobile devices**.
* ✅ Operates on a **centralized and scalable SaaS architecture**.
* ✅ Requires **minimal hardware infrastructure** (USB readers vs Biometric scanners).
* ✅ **Seamlessly integrates** attendance, canteen, and library systems.

## 5. Justification for Selection
The proposed **NFC-based SaaS solution** addresses the weaknesses of existing and alternative methods while offering better efficiency, security, and user experience.

Its centralized and scalable design makes it adaptable for institutions of different sizes, while keeping deployment and maintenance costs reasonable compared to heavy ERP or Biometric systems.
